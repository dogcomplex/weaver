/**
 * Loom Theme — The First Glamour
 *
 * The weaving lexicon from CLAUDE.md becomes literal visual elements.
 * Each ComfyUI knot type maps to a loom component:
 *   CheckpointLoader → Spindle, CLIPTextEncode → Dye Vat,
 *   KSampler → Heddle Frame, VAEDecode → Winding Frame,
 *   SaveImage → Cloth Beam, EmptyLatentImage → Fiber Bundle,
 *   default → Tied Knot.
 *
 * Threads are literal threads colored by data type.
 * Waves are shuttles carrying weft across the warp.
