Text input handling is excellent (9/10) — prompts remain textual vision notes. Model handling is strong (8/10) — clay source is intuitive. However, truthfulness suffers (6.8) due to weak intermediate mappings: latent space as 'prepared clay' is loose (6.5/10 elementFit), and VAE decode as 'cooling/glazing' misrepresents the actual mathematical operation (5.5/10 elementFit). The KSampler kiln metaphor is strong for steps (8/10) and seed (7/10) but breaks on sampler_name (6/10) and scheduler (5/10) controls — advanced parameters don't map intuitively. Completeness is good (8.0) — all major knots have mappings and key parameters have controls. Intuitive interaction is solid (7.2) — beginning-to-intermediate users will understand the workflow naturally, though power users will find sampler/scheduler controls unhelpful. Fractal consistency is moderate (6.5) — clay metaphor is consistent, kiln metaphor is consistent, but VAE decode breaks the craft metaphor. Overall 7.2 reflects a solid, usable metaphor with good narrative arc and text-handling clarity, but with acknowledged gaps in abstract parameter representation and technical accuracy on intermediate steps. Strengths: text prompts stay textual, familiar craft domain, intuitive controls for core parameters (steps, seed, batch). Weaknesses: sampler/scheduler controls unintuitive, VAE mapping is weak, latent space abstraction loose, final output mismatch (digital file vs physical piece)."
