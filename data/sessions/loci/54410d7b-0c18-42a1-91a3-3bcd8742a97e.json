(3) Camera selection and film format are intuitive (8/10 model and intermediate handling). (4) Final output correctly maps to 'developed print' with file naming (9/10 final handling). (5) Audience can visualize the entire workflow as a darkroom sequence. WEAKNESSES: (1) Seed as 'exposure index' is somewhat forced (6/10 truthfulness); it's not entirely wrong but less intuitive than 'randomness source.' (2) Sampler and scheduler controls are abstract and don't map clearly to darkroom equipment (5-6/10 explanatory power); photographers don't select 'development methods' explicitly. (3) Latent space abstraction loses some technical precision (7/10 intermediate handling). COMPLETENESS: All knots have metaphor mappings; most key parameters have facade controls. Minor controls (scheduler, sampler) are included but less polished. Overall completeness is high (8.5/10). CONSISTENCY: Metaphor is relatively uniform—all elements fit within a darkroom workspace scenario. Some variance in how abstract (latent) vs. concrete (film format) elements are treated, but variance is acceptable (8.1/10 fractal consistency). OVERALL SCORE: 8.1/10—a robust, experientially intuitive metaphor that excels at preserving text input fidelity while offering photographers a familiar mental model."

However, truthfulness suffers (6.8) due to weak intermediate mappings: latent space as 'prepared clay' is loose (6.5/10 elementFit), and VAE decode as 'cooling/glazing' misrepresents the actual mathematical operation (5.5/10 elementFit). The KSampler kiln metaphor is strong for steps (8/10) and seed (7/10) but breaks on sampler_name (6/10) and scheduler (5/10) controls — advanced parameters don't map intuitively. Completeness is good (8.0) — all major knots have mappings and key parameters have controls. Intuitive interaction is solid (7.2) — beginning-to-intermediate users will understand the workflow naturally, though power users will find sampler/scheduler controls unhelpful. Fractal consistency is moderate (6.5) — clay metaphor is consistent, kiln metaphor is consistent, but VAE decode breaks the craft metaphor. Overall 7.2 reflects a solid, usable metaphor with good narrative arc and text-handling clarity, but with acknowledged gaps in abstract parameter representation and technical accuracy on intermediate steps. Strengths: text prompts stay textual, familiar craft domain, intuitive controls for core parameters (steps, seed, batch). Weaknesses: sampler/scheduler controls unintuitive, VAE mapping is weak, latent space abstraction loose, final output mismatch (digital file vs physical piece)."
