                "rationale": "The Orchestral Symphony metaphor is strong and coherent. Explanatory Power (8/10): Text prompts as composition, sampling as rehearsal, and output as a recorded release are all clear and intuitive. The orchestra framing explains how diverse inputs combine into a unified output. Truthfulness (8/10): Facade controls mostly map directly to parameters (steps→passes, CFG→adherence, denoise→refinement). Weaknesses: sampler_name and scheduler are somewhat loose abstractions (6/10 each); VAE decode as 'mastering' is moderately abstract. Completeness (9/10): All major knots are mapped. Positive/negative text prompts both included. All critical KSampler parameters have controls (steps, CFG, seed, sampler, scheduler, denoise). Minor: VAE and Save have no extensive controls, but that's appropriate (VAE is pass-through; Save is simple). Intuitive Interaction (8/10): Rehearsal metaphor is genuinely intuitive for diffusion sampling. Text-based composition maps well to text prompts. Stage dimensions are clear. Weaknesses: latent space (6/10) and mastering (6/10) are abstract. Fractal Consistency (8/10): The metaphor is mostly uniform — musical/orchestral elements throughout. Slight inconsistency: audio mastering in a visual workflow, and final output is images not sound. But the 'recording → vinyl release' frame bridges this acceptably. Overall: 8.1/10 weighted average (0.30×8 + 0.25×8 + 0.20×9 + 0.15×8 + 0.10×8 = 8.1). This is a coherent, user-friendly metaphor that preserves critical information (text input) while adding intuitive framing. Key strengths: excellent text prompt handling (9/10), excellent sampling explanation (8-9/10), strong output framing (8/10). Key weaknesses: latent space abstraction (6/10), sampler/scheduler looseness (6/10), audio-image mismatch (minor).",

Strengths: (1) Text input handling is exceptional (9/10)—prompts remain textual on sketches. (2) The core generation step (KSampler) is mapped brilliantly: steps as shaping passes (9/10 explanatory), CFG as sketch adherence (9/10 intuitive). (3) Completeness is high (9/10)—all knots have clear mappings and most parameters have facade controls. (4) Intuitive interaction is strong (8/10)—the controls feel natural in a studio context. Weaknesses: (1) Scheduler mapping is stretched (6/10 truthfulness)—cooling isn't naturally part of torch work. (2) Sampler naming is abstract (7/10 explanatory)—hard to explain why 'DPM++' is a technique without teaching users diffusion theory. (3) Intermediate data (latent space) is moderately abstracted (7/10)—'molten glass structure' is poetic but not deeply grounded. (4) Fractal consistency is good (8/10) but not perfect—the studio setting is unified, but some controls (sampler, scheduler) require more technical knowledge to understand. Overall, this metaphor balances accessibility with craft authenticity. It will resonate strongly with people who appreciate art and craftsmanship, while remaining intuitive for general users.",

Explanatory power (8): Nearly every knot has an intuitive mapping (camera selection, lighting, film stock, development, fixing, printing). Five of six parameter controls score 7-9 on explanatory power. Truthfulness (7): Text inputs are preserved (9/10). Model selection is truthful (8/10). Development/exposure controls map well to actual parameters (7-8/10). Scheduler and denoise are looser metaphors (5-6/10), pulling the average down. Overall truthfulness is solid but not perfect. Completeness (9): All seven knots are mapped. Six of seven have detailed facade controls. Only VAE decode lacks interactive controls, which is acceptable since VAE parameters are typically hidden. Intuitive interaction (8): Sliders for dimensions, dropdowns for selections, text for prompts, and the development process feel natural. Photographers will find this immediately accessible; non-photographers may need brief orientation to sampler/scheduler. Fractal consistency (8): The metaphor is uniform — every knot fits within a darkroom studio workflow. There's good consistency in how data flows (light rays, chemicals, negatives, prints). Variance is low except for the scheduler/denoise pair, which are more abstract. Key strengths: Text input remains textual, preserving user capability. The core generation (KSampler as development) is intuitive. The overall scene is cohesive and familiar to many. Key weaknesses: Scheduler and denoise are relatively abstract (5-6). VAE is somewhat opaque. The metaphor is photography-biased, so non-photographers may need more explanation. However, for mixed audiences, photography is reasonably universal.",

                  "rationale": "The Orchestral Symphony metaphor is strong and coherent. Explanatory Power (8/10): Text prompts as composition, sampling as rehearsal, and output as a recorded release are all clear and intuitive. The orchestra framing explains how diverse inputs combine into a unified output. Truthfulness (8/10): Facade controls mostly map directly to parameters (steps→passes, CFG→adherence, denoise→refinement). Weaknesses: sampler_name and scheduler are somewhat loose abstractions (6/10 each); VAE decode as 'mastering' is moderately abstract. Completeness (9/10): All major knots are mapped. Positive/negative text prompts both included. All critical KSampler parameters have controls (steps, CFG, seed, sampler, scheduler, denoise). Minor: VAE and Save have no extensive controls, but that's appropriate (VAE is pass-through; Save is simple). Intuitive Interaction (8/10): Rehearsal metaphor is genuinely intuitive for diffusion sampling. Text-based composition maps well to text prompts. Stage dimensions are clear. Weaknesses: latent space (6/10) and mastering (6/10) are abstract. Fractal Consistency (8/10): The metaphor is mostly uniform — musical/orchestral elements throughout. Slight inconsistency: audio mastering in a visual workflow, and final output is images not sound. But the 'recording → vinyl release' frame bridges this acceptably. Overall: 8.1/10 weighted average (0.30×8 + 0.25×8 + 0.20×9 + 0.15×8 + 0.10×8 = 8.1). This is a coherent, user-friendly metaphor that preserves critical information (text input) while adding intuitive framing. Key strengths: excellent text prompt handling (9/10), excellent sampling explanation (8-9/10), strong output framing (8/10). Key weaknesses: latent space abstraction (6/10), sampler/scheduler looseness (6/10), audio-image mismatch (minor)."

Weaknesses: (1) Scheduler mapping is stretched (6/10 truthfulness)—cooling isn't naturally part of torch work. (2) Sampler naming is abstract (7/10 explanatory)—hard to explain why 'DPM++' is a technique without teaching users diffusion theory. (3) Intermediate data (latent space) is moderately abstracted (7/10)—'molten glass structure' is poetic but not deeply grounded. (4) Fractal consistency is good (8/10) but not perfect—the studio setting is unified, but some controls (sampler, scheduler) require more technical knowledge to understand.

Explanatory power (8): Nearly every knot has an intuitive mapping (camera selection, lighting, film stock, development, fixing, printing). Five of six parameter controls score 7-9 on explanatory power. Truthfulness (7): Text inputs are preserved (9/10). Model selection is truthful (8/10). Development/exposure controls map well to actual parameters (7-8/10). Scheduler and denoise are looser metaphors (5-6/10), pulling the average down. Overall truthfulness is solid but not perfect. Completeness (9): All seven knots are mapped. Six of seven have detailed facade controls. Only VAE decode lacks interactive controls, which is acceptable since VAE parameters are typically hidden. Intuitive interaction (8): Sliders for dimensions, dropdowns for selections, text for prompts, and the development process feel natural. Photographers will find this immediately accessible; non-photographers may need brief orientation to sampler/scheduler. Fractal consistency (8): The metaphor is uniform — every knot fits within a darkroom studio workflow. There's good consistency in how data flows (light rays, chemicals, negatives, prints). Variance is low except for the scheduler/denoise pair, which are more abstract. Key strengths: Text input remains textual, preserving user capability. The core generation (KSampler as development) is intuitive. The overall scene is cohesive and familiar to many. Key weaknesses: Scheduler and denoise are relatively abstract (5-6). VAE is somewhat opaque. The metaphor is photography-biased, so non-photographers may need more explanation. However, for mixed audiences, photography is reasonably universal."
